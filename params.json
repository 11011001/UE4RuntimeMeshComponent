  "body": "# UE4 Runtime Mesh Component\r\n\r\nThe Runtime Mesh Component allows for rendering runtime generated meshes as well as supporting collision with the runtime generated meshes. It is also nearly 100% compatible with the UE4 UProceduralMeshComponent\r\n\r\n**Examples project can be found here https://github.com/Koderz/UE4RuntimeMeshComponentExamples**\r\n\r\n**Improvements over UE4 UProceduralMeshComponent:**\r\n* More efficient rendering.\r\n* Static objects use the fastest available rendering path.\r\n* Faster updates to sections for frame-by-frame update scenarios.\r\n* Corrected collision support, less cooking overhead. (More to come later)\r\n* 50%+ memory reduction.\r\n* Custom vertex structure support.\r\n* Multiple UV channel support.\r\n* Collision only mesh sections.\r\n* Shadow casting controllable per section.\r\n* Serialization configurable to reduce map sizes when mesh saves aren't necessary.\r\n",
